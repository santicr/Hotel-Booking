# Hotel-Reservation
Miniproject using flask, reservation hotel and management of the reservations. I used txt files as data base.

For this project, I used Flask, url_for and redirect libraries/frameworks.
I used txt files as data base for user data and for reservation data.
User data called 'datos.txt' has the name, last name, credit card number and security code of the credit card.
The purpose of this project is to get acquainted with flask, open / read / write txt files, use of bootstrap for basic web design. Some web pages has no
styles. (main purpose: back-end).
